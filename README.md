## Project Goals

1. **Highly Secure Network Infrastructure (VPC)**:
   - Design and implement a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that isolates resources and controls network traffic to enhance security.

2. **Highly Available Infrastructure**:
   - Ensure that the infrastructure is resilient and available at all times by leveraging AWS services and best practices for high availability.

3. **Tight Security**:
   - Implement tight security measures to protect the infrastructure from potential threats and vulnerabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS**: The primary cloud service provider for hosting the infrastructure.
- **Terraform**: The infrastructure as code tool used to provision and manage the AWS resources.

## Getting Started
